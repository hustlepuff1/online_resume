                    <strong>✈️ AIRCRAFT DISASSEMBLY | KOREAN AIR A360</strong>
                    <p>07/2021</p>
                    <p> During covid season, I was lucky enough to get an internship on 
                        disassembling an aircraft of Korean Air. 
                        It was an Airbus 300-600 which was at Korean Air, Gimpo. 
                        The job of disassembling an Aircraft was hard and brutal. 
                        I had to get in the fuel tanks in the wings and use a grinder to cut 
                        the bolts in the wings. 
                        But it was a valuable experience and made the ideology inside me to 
                        make it a life's mission to help hard-working technicians.</p>

                    <p> During my degree at one of the most prestigious community colleges in 
                        South Korea I learnt lots of key skills such as teamwork and fixing 
                        problems. Although we mainly focused on maintaining the airworthiness 
                        of the aircraft, I use a lot of these skills to my advantage in my 
                        journey on become an Aerospace Engineer. 
                        While at Inha Tech I got a lot of licenses and studied hard to get the 
                        valedictorian certificate. </p>
